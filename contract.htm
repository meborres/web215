	<h2>Michael Borresen</h2>
	<div id="contract">
		<p>I, Michael Borresen agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2013 Web 215 Advanced Markup and Scripting with my instructor, DI von Briesen.</p>
		<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
		<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
		<p>Signed: Michael Borresen, August 20, 2013.</p>
